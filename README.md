SorachanCoin - a hybrid scrypt PoW + PoS based cryptocurrency.

What is the SorachanCoin?
===========================

The purpose of this coin is to change the drive failure prediction detection function(case: S.M.A.R.T.) to "reliable".

The drive failure prediction and detection function called "S.M.A.R.T." is many years of investigation(15 years), 
therefore i think that it is under the control of something that is into strange thoughts.
For example, recently, the tendency is even stronger, 
and we can not catch notifications of breakdown to regardless of "normal" of status, 
but actually, just a few changes to the firmware may resume reading.

What is SorachanCoin?
===========================

When using a personal computer, data backup is always a concern. Especially recently, online storage has been charged fee one after another, and we think that many people have returned to the local environment.  
  
There is "S.M.A.R.T.", the state of the drive seems to decide. However, if you believe in this system, you will almost certainly lose data without being able to back up. This is because this indicator does not denote the correct one.  
  
We have not find broken indicator for over 17 years. Then, there is nothing to expect and we came to result in that we can not trust "S.M.A.R.T.".  
  
Therefore, by utilizing the "inspection" that has no choice but to surely produce results, the mission of this Blockchain is to try to derive the predicted information.
